# COT5615-Math-for-Intelligent-Systems-Fall-2018
I took Math for Intelligent System COT5615 in fall 2018 offered by University of Florida. In this repo I am sharing the assignments, lecture PPTs and my code for the same. I have seen very common questions like "What are the topics I should go through for machine learning?", and topics of the PPTs, in my opinion will give you a clear idea about that. This was an awesome but very intensive course. Have a look!!
